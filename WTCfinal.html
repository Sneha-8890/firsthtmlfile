        WTC Final India vs New Zealand highlights: Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor put on a solid partnership as New Zealand chased down the 139-run target to beat India by 8 wickets and lift the inaugural WTC title. Ravichandran Ashwin gave India a glimmer of hope by sending back both the New Zealand openers but it was not enough.
         Indian batsmen performed poorly on the reserve day as they could only add 106 runs for the loss of 8 wickets. <br>
         New Zealand were set a target of 139 runs to win the first-ever Test Championship after bowling out India for just 170. 
         Due to poor weather, the game entered the reserve day.<br>
