    <p>The ICC World Test Championship is a league competition for Test cricket run by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which started on 1 August 2019.
        It is intended to be the premier championship for Test cricket.<br>
        It is in line with the ICC's goal of having one pinnacle tournament for each of the three formats of international cricket.
        <br>The first tournament began with the 2019 Ashes series. In March 2020, matches were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not resuming before July 2020, with several rounds of matches being postponed or ultimately cancelled.
         New Zealand became the first team to qualify for the final, when it was confirmed that the series between South Africa and Australia would not proceed, followed by India. 
         The inaugural World Test Championship Final was played between India and New Zealand from 18â€“23 June 2021 at Rose Bowl, Southampton, England.
        Despite the opening and fourth day of the final being washed out by rain, New Zealand managed to win in the final session of the reserve day and lifted the first World Test Championship trophy.</p>
